This is a simple game meant to simulate the functions and environment of a cleaning robot. Score is kept by how much unique area of the floor the robot traverses over. The map automatically resets whenever the robot collides with a white barrier. The robot has four proximity sensors: a left, right, and central beam. These beam collisions can be checked and mapped to different outputs, but this application simply prints to the terminal if a beam is triggered. This game is specifically designed to be adapted to a reinforcment learning program to create a general neural network for cleaning robots.
